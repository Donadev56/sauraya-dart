## Introduction
Sauraya is a modern user interface designed to interact with open-source AI models such as Meta's LLama. This application is fully open-source and free, created to provide the benefits of Meta's AI products to a broader audience without the need for setting up resource-intensive local environments. With Sauraya, users simply download the app from [Sauraya.com](https://sauraya.com), install it, and start engaging with Meta's advanced AI models. 

Sauraya is free and maintained by the **Opennode Team** ([opennode.tech](https://opennode.tech)).

## Privacy-Focused and Local Storage
Sauraya prioritizes user privacy by storing all conversations locally in an encrypted file accessible on Android at:

```
/android/com.sauraya/database/user-id.sauraya.crypt
```

The conversation file is a lightweight JSON, ensuring minimal storage usage. Upon app launch, file system access will be required. 

Sauraya does not collect any user data, focusing solely on confidentiality. Users can perform various actions through the website, such as:
- Executing Python code
- Listening to AI-generated text via text-to-speech
- Renaming conversation titles
- And much more, with future updates to come.

The team works tirelessly to maintain and improve the application.
